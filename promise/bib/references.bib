@unpublished{Karakostas2019Egalitarianism,
abstract = {Since the invention of Bitcoin one decade ago, numerous cryptocurrencies have sprung into existence. Among these, proof-of-work is the most common mechanism for achieving consensus, whilst a number of coins have adopted "ASIC-resistance" as a desirable property, claiming to be more "egalitarian,"S where egalitarianism refers to the power of each coin to participate in the creation of new coins. While proof-of-work consensus dominates the space, several new cryptocurrencies employ alternative consensus, such as proof-of-stake in which block minting opportunities are based on monetary ownership. A core criticism of proof-of-stake revolves around it being less egalitarian by making the rich richer, as opposed to proof-of-work in which everyone can contribute equally according to their computational power. In this paper, we give the first quantitative definition of a cryptocurrency's $\backslash$emph{\{}egalitarianism{\}}. Based on our definition, we measure the egalitarianism of popular cryptocurrencies that (may or may not) employ ASIC-resistance, among them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Our simulations show, as expected, that ASIC-resistance increases a cryptocurrency's egalitarianism. We also measure the egalitarianism of a stake-based protocol, Ouroboros, and a hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work cryptocurrency, Decred. We show that stake-based cryptocurrencies, under correctly selected parameters, can be perfectly egalitarian, perhaps contradicting folklore belief.},

@unpublished{Teutsch2019Boostrap,
abstract = {We outline a token model for Truebit, a retrofitting, blockchain enhancement which enables secure, community-based computation. The model addresses the challenge of stable task pricing, as raised in the Truebit whitepaper, without appealing to external oracles, exchanges, or hierarchical nodes. The system's sustainable economics and fair market pricing derive from a mintable token format which leverages existing tokens for liquidity. Finally, we introduce a governance layer whose lifecycles culminates with permanent dissolution into utility tokens, thereby tending the network towards autonomous decentralization.},

@inproceedings{Fanti2019Compounding,
abstract = {Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a promising approach for designing efficient blockchains, where block proposers are randomly chosen with probability proportional to their stake. A primary concern with PoS systems is the "rich getting richer" phenomenon, whereby wealthier nodes are more likely to get elected, and hence reap the block reward, making them even wealthier. In this paper, we introduce the notion of equitability, which quantifies how much a proposer can amplify her stake compared to her initial investment. Even with everyone following protocol (i.e., honest behavior), we show that existing methods of allocating block rewards lead to poor equitability, as does initializing systems with small stake pools and/or large rewards relative to the stake pool. We identify a $\backslash$emph{\{}geometric{\}} reward function, which we prove is maximally equitable over all choices of reward functions under honest behavior and bound the deviation for strategic actions; the proofs involve the study of optimization problems and stochastic dominances of Polya urn processes, and are of independent mathematical interest. These results allow us to provide a systematic framework to choose the parameters of a practical incentive system for PoS cryptocurrencies.},

abstract = {We consider algorithmic problems in a distributed setting where the participants cannot be assumed to follow the algorithm but rather their own self-interest. As such participants, termed agents, are capable of manipulating the algorithm, the algorithm designer should ensure in advance that the agents' interests are best served by behaving correctly. Following notions from the field of mechanism design, we suggest a framework for studying such algorithms. Our main technical contribution concerns the study of a representative task scheduling problem for which the standard mechanism design tools do not suffice. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, there has been explosive growth in the research done at the in-terface of computer science, game theory, and economic theory, largely motivated by the emergence of the Internet. Algorithmic Game Theory develops the central ideas and results of this new and exciting area. More than 40 of the top researchers in this field have written chapters whose topics range from the foundations to the state of the art. This book contains an extensive treatment of algorithms for equilibria in games and markets, computational auctions and mechanism design, and the " price of anarchy, " as well as applications in networks, peer-to-peer systems, security, information markets, and more.},
